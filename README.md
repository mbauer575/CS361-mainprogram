This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Check out the UI liberary I used: [`Rsuite`](https://rsuitejs.com/)

## Requirements:

This website requires the use of a backend service to store and retrieve data. The source code for that can be found [here](https://github.com/mbauer575/CS361-datastore).
